# Basic Weather Application

This is a basic weather application created using **Spring Boot**. The application allows users to check weather information, showcasing how to build a web application with Java and Spring Boot.

## Features

- Fetches and displays weather information.
- Built with **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf** for the frontend.
- Integrated with **Docker** for easy deployment and environment management.

## Build Tool

This project uses **Maven** as the build tool to manage dependencies and build the application.

## Docker Support

A Dockerfile is included in the project, allowing you to build and run the application in a containerized environment. This simplifies the setup process and ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed on your machine.
- **Java 17** (for development purposes, if you want to build the application locally).
- **Maven** installed on your machine (for local builds).

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbuntyz/SpringBoot.git
   cd SpringBoot
=======
**Edit a file, create a new file, and clone from Bitbucket in under 2 minutes**

When you're done, you can delete the content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your repository.

*We recommend that you open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You can [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo) for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.*

## Edit a file

You’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Source** on the left side.
2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*
5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.
6. Go back to the **Source** page.

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
